🎬 B-Roll lets you track your latest binge! This web-app, written in TypeScript (using Next.js), let's you rate and review television episodes. The episode data will be be populated via API routes from a SQL db, which will be updated daily using Python + cron jobs. Users will be able to friend and communicate with other users via WebSockets and MongoDB.
